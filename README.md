# Github REST API exercise

## Pre-req

- Node v12+

## Installation

- run `yarn` or `npm`

## Starting the app

- run `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Things I would do differently/add with more time

- Static sizing for cards so it does not push the pagination buttons out of its original position
  - limit the description length and add ellipsis to the end to note additional text
- Add data validations
  - Such as checking the repo name and owner is passed in as an objected to the commit modal before rendering
- Working linter and formatter
- Better mobile support
- Error handling such as logging
- Style commit modal
- Format commit date
- Disable pagination buttons when there are no additional pages
